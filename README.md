# Functional Programming with Java

#### The operations that are performed on a Stream and those that return Stream back are called INTERMEDIATE operations. Some examples are:
- .distinct() _return => Stream<T>_
- .sorted() _return => Stream<T>_
- .map() _return => Stream<R>_
- .filter() _return => Stream<T>_
